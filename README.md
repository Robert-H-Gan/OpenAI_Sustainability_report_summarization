# OpenAI_Sustainability_report_summarization

During OpenAI Hackathon for Climate change 2022, my teammate @Matthys du Toit and I explored a number of ideas on how current AI models can accelerate solutions for climate change. This repo is dedicated to the work done during that hackathon. 

We believe that capital allocation towards sustainable companies would help in reaching the net-zero economy goal in 2050. This is why we leveraged OpenAI API and the power delivered by #gpt3 to build our Sustainability Report Summarization tool.

### Context:
Companies have an important role to play in reaching the net-zero economy goal in 2050. More and more governments worldwide have published regulations requiring investors and their portfolio companies to publish their climate transition reports.

### Problem:
However, investing in genuinely sustainable companies is hard. Investors are not climate scientists and they do not have the time or the knowledge to inspect all aspects of companiesâ€™ lengthy reports. To transition into a net-zero economy, investors need better insight into the implications of company transition plans.

### Solution:
To tackle that problem, we created the tool that would give more visibility to investors. Our tool can provide quick and effective reviews of sustainability reports. It can summarize lengthy reports (which are often longer than 100 pages) into 1 paragraph.

### Impact on climate change:
We believe that allocating capitals to sustainable businesses will push good sustainable strategies to flourish. As a consequence, companies will adopt promising and realistic sustainability strategies in order to attract investments.
